
 # Orbital Period and Orbital Radius

## Motivation
Kepler's Third Law provides a fundamental insight into orbital mechanics:

> The square of the orbital period ($T^2$) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($r^3$) of its orbit:

$$ T^2 \propto r^3 $$

This law is essential for understanding the motion of celestial bodies under the influence of gravity.

## Derivation for Circular Orbits

Consider a body of mass $m$ orbiting a larger mass $M$ (e.g., a planet orbiting the Sun) in a circular orbit.

1. Gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force:

$$ \frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r} $$

2. Simplify and solve for velocity $v$:

$$ v^2 = \frac{G M}{r} $$

3. Orbital period is:

$$ T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} $$

Substitute $v$:

$$ T = 2\pi r \sqrt{\frac{r}{G M}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{G M}} $$

4. Therefore,

$$ T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G M} $$

This confirms Kepler's Third Law:

$$ T^2 \propto r^3 $$

## Implications in Astronomy

- Allows determination of planetary masses.
- Enables calculation of distances in planetary systems.
- Satellite orbit planning relies heavily on this law.
- Used in exoplanet studies to estimate star and planet properties.

## Real-World Examples

### Example: Moon Around Earth
- Orbital radius $r \approx 3.84 \times 10^8$ m
- Orbital period $T \approx 27.3$ days $= 2.36 \times 10^6$ s

Compute $\frac{T^2}{r^3}$:

$$ \frac{(2.36 \times 10^6)^2}{(3.84 \times 10^8)^3} \approx 2.95 \times 10^{-14} $$

### Example: Earth Around Sun
- $r \approx 1.5 \times 10^{11}$ m
- $T = 1$ year $= 3.15 \times 10^7$ s

$$ \frac{T^2}{r^3} \approx 2.96 \times 10^{-19} $$



## Extension to Elliptical Orbits
Kepler's Third Law also holds for elliptical orbits when $r$ is replaced with the semi-major axis $a$:

$$ T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G M} $$

This general form explains motions of planets, comets, and exoplanets with non-circular orbits.

# Orbital Period and Orbital Radius

## Motivation

The relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, known as **Kepler's Third Law**, forms a foundational pillar of celestial mechanics. It reveals the harmony of planetary motion and provides a gateway to calculating distances and masses in space.

## Kepler's Third Law: Derivation for Circular Orbits

From Newton's law of gravitation and centripetal force:



## Kepler’s Third Law

From Newton’s law of gravitation and the requirement for centripetal force:

$$
F = \frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \frac{v^2}{r} \Rightarrow v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
$$

Orbital period $T$ is the time taken to complete one full orbit:

$$
T = \frac{2 \pi r}{v} = 2 \pi r \cdot \sqrt{\frac{r}{G M}} = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{G M}}
$$

Thus:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M} r^3
$$

This shows:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

## Applications in Astronomy

- **Planetary Motion**: By observing $T$, we can estimate orbital radius $r$.
- **Satellite Orbits**: Used to determine periods for communication and GPS satellites.
- **Binary Star Systems**: Inferring masses from orbital characteristics.
