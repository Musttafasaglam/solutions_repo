Theoretical Foundation Deriving the Governing Equations The motion of a projectile can be described by applying Newton's second law. For a projectile launched from an initial position with velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) with respect to the horizontal, we have: In the horizontal direction (x-axis): \\( \\(\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0\\) \\) \\[\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g\\] Where \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2 on Earth). Integrating these equations with respect to time with initial conditions: - \\(x(0) = 0\\) - \\(y(0) = h\\) (initial height) - \\(v_x(0) = v_0\\cos(\\theta)\\) - \\(v_y(0) = v_0\\sin(\\theta)\\) We obtain: \\[x(t) = (v_0\\cos\\theta)t y(t) = h + (v_0\\sin\\theta)t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\] These parametric equations describe the position of the projectile at any time \\(t\\) . Family of Solutions The family of solutions is defined by varying the parameters: - Initial velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) - Launch angle ( \\(\\theta\\) ) - Initial height ( \\(h\\) ) - Gravitational acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) Each combination of these parameters produces a unique trajectory. 2. Analysis of the Range Range Equation The range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance traveled when the projectile returns to its initial height. To find this, we need to determine when \\(y(t) = h\\) : \\[h + (v_0\\sin\\theta)t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = h\\] Simplifying: \\( \\((v_0\\sin\\theta)t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = 0\\) \\) This equation has two solutions: \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = \\frac{2v_0\\sin\\theta}{g}\\) The second solution gives us the time of flight. The range is then: \\[R = (v_0\\cos\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2v_0\\sin\\theta}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin(2\\theta)}{g}\\] This demonstrates that the range is proportional to: - The square of the initial velocity - The sine of twice the angle of projection - Inversely proportional to the gravitational acceleration Optimal Angle for Maximum Range To find the angle that maximizes the range, we differentiate with respect to \\(\\theta\\) and set it equal to zero: \\[\\frac{dR}{d\\theta} = \\frac{v_0^2\\cos(2\\theta)}{g} = 0\\] This gives us \\(\\cos(2\\theta) = 0\\) , thus \\(2\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) or \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 45\u00b0\\) Therefore, in the absence of air resistance and with a level landing surface, the maximum range is achieved at a 45\u00b0 angle. Effect of Initial Height If the projectile is launched from a height \\(h\\) above the landing surface, the range equation becomes more complex: \\[R = v_0\\cos\\theta \\cdot t_{landing}\\] Where \\(t_{landing}\\) is the time when the projectile reaches the ground level ( \\(y = 0\\) ): \\[h + (v_0\\sin\\theta)t_{landing} - \\frac{1}{2}gt_{landing}^2 = 0\\] Solving this quadratic equation: \\[t_{landing} = \\frac{v_0\\sin\\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0\\sin\\theta)^2 + 2gh}}{g}\\] This means that the range now depends on the initial height as well: \\[R = v_0\\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{v_0\\sin\\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0\\sin\\theta)^2 + 2gh}}{g}\\] 3. Practical Applications Real-world Considerations In practice, projectile motion is influenced by: - Air resistance (drag) - Wind - Varying gravitational field - Rotating reference frames (Coriolis effect) - Non-uniform terrain Incorporating Air Resistance A simple model for air resistance is to include a drag force proportional to velocity: \\[F_d = -bv\\] This leads to a modified set of differential equations: \\[\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = $$-\\frac{b}{m}v_x$$ $$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = $$-g - \\frac{b}{m}v_y\\] Where \\(b\\) is the drag coefficient and \\(m\\) is the mass of the projectile. These equations typically require numerical methods to solve. !","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-theoretical-foundation","text":"","title":"1.

This motion is central to space operations such as orbital insertion, satellite deployment, and atmospheric reentry. Understanding these paths enables precise mission planning and execution. Core Physical Principles Universal Gravitation According to Newton\u2019s Law: \\ $$ F = G \\frac{M m}{r^2} $$ \\ Where: \\( M \\) : Earth's mass \\( m \\) : payload mass \\( r \\) : distance from Earth's center Gravitational Acceleration The gravitational force results in an acceleration: [ $$ \\vec{a} = -\\frac{G M}{r^3} \\vec{r} $$ ] This acceleration always points toward Earth\u2019s center and governs the curvature of the path. Trajectory Types Based on Energy The total mechanical energy \\( E \\) of the payload is: [ $$ E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{G M m}{r} $$ ] This determines the type of trajectory: Elliptical orbit \\( (E < 0) \\) : Bound, repeating path Parabolic escape \\( (E = 0) \\) : Just enough energy to escape Hyperbolic escape \\( (E > 0) \\) : Escapes with excess energy Escape Velocity The threshold for unbound motion: [ $$ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} $$ ] If a payload exceeds this, it is no longer gravitationally bound to Earth. Simulation Strategy We simulate the motion using semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler integration to better conserve energy in long-term simulations. This gives us better behavior in near-orbit paths compared to naive Euler.","title":"Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#trajectories-of-a-freely-released-payload-near-earth","text":"","title":"Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#motivation","text":"When a payload is released from a moving rocket or satellite near Earth, its path is dictated by the delicate balance of gravitational pull and the initial velocity vector.
